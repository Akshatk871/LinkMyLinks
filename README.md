# LinkMyLinks
 
The purpose of this project is to enable link tracking by simply remembering your login credentials. This will allow you to retrieve important links that you may have forgotten. The key difference between this project and other link-sharing websites is that while others only offer the ability to add social or public links, this project allows you to organize your links into categories, mark specific links as private, and even designate certain groups as private. This means that public links will be visible on your profile even if they are accessed without your login information.

## Note
If you want to work only on the frontend, the backend is hosted on vercel, you can check that out!

## Future Ideas

1. Collaboration features: This would allow users to share their links and categories with other users, as well as work together on link curation and organization.

2. Browser extension: A browser extension could be developed to allow users to quickly add links to their project from any webpage they are currently viewing.

3. Adding search functionality:  This would enable users to quickly and easily find specific links or categories within their collection. 

## TODOS

1. Improving the UI, by using Tailwind CSS/ Custom Componets
2. Removing the Custom CSS to make the Website less laggy
3. Adding a Search Feature
4. Fixing the Issue such as, Adding a list type, making a link private
